The Allegheny County Illegal Dump Site dataset includes information from 2005 about the estimated tons of trash at a specific dump site, the site name, which neighborhood in Pittsburgh the site is located in, and whether or not the site has been cleaned. Some locations also include a brief description of the dumpsite. The information for this dataset was provided by Allegheny Cleanways.

The Daily Air Quality Index for Allegheny County data set uses the US national Air Quality Index to determine the daily averages in 13 different sites located in Allegheny County. The Air Quality Index used S02 levels to measure the air quality. The dataset also provided descriptions on the air quality if it the air was extremely polluted. The dataset started documenting the AQI per day in 2016 to the present. 

# Abstract: 
The best neighborhood is Pittsburgh is ...
Using our metrics of air quality, number of exemptions from the Allegheny County Clean Indoor Air Act, and number and amount of trash at illegal dump sites in the neighborhood, we could determine the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on how green and clean the area is. To be considered the best neighborhood and ranked the highest by our metrics, it would have to have the best air quality, the least number of exemptions from the Indoor Air Act, the least amount of total trash, and least number of illegal dump sites.
